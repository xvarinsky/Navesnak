3. **cat_ears.png** - Cat ears filter (positioned above head)
4. **unicorn.png** - Unicorn horn filter (positioned on forehead)
5. **clown_nose.png** - Clown nose filter (positioned on nose tip)

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency (alpha channel)
- **Transparency**: Use transparent background for best results

- **Orientation**: Filters should face forward (will be mirrored automatically)

## Tips
